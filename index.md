## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kosticlab/microbialgenes.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

# The pan-ecological gene universe of metagenomics

<p>This resource accompanies a submitted manuscript exploring the gene content of microbiomes (microbial communities) across 17 different ecologies, including humans, animals, and other environmental sources. The link below will lead you to a download page for our gene resources, and the abstract describes our findings, which notably include an unprecendent appreciation for conservation of certain genes across different environments.</p>

<p> When our work is available online, we will include a link to the manuscript here. </p>

## Abstract
